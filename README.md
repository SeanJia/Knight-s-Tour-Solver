## Introduction
KTGui, created by Zhiwei Jia, is the main class for this tool. 
This tool is aimed to solve the Knight's Tour puzzle and is 
implemented using traditional graph search algorithm with a 
a designed multi-threading technique

Size of the board has three options: 8x8, 6x6, or 4x4.
Mostly of the problems can be solved within a few seconds,
whereas some might take around 2 minutes, based on my test.
Be patient while waiting for the result, as basically this
Knight's Tour problem is intractable, as it asks to find 
Hamiltonian paths.
